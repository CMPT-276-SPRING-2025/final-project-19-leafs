## Our Project
Finding affordable and convenient flight tickets can be time-consuming and overwhelming. Users often need to search multiple websites, compare prices, and check real-time flight statuses before making a booking decision. Our project aims to simplify this process by providing a user-friendly interface to search for flights, check prices, and get real-time flight updates, all in one place. Additionally, an AI-powered chatbot will assist users with their queries, making the experience more interactive and efficient.
